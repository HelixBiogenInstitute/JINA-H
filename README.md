The **Joint Interactive Nucleotide Analysis-Helix**  was developed at Helix Biogen Institute and is designed to calculate sequence lenght, GC content, start codon and stop codon, protein translation of DNA and RNA sequences and predict the 3D model of the sequence. 

Input should be a text or fasta file with **single line spacing** between multiple sequences.

Maximum Sequence size for Seqeunce Properties depends on system resources

Maximum sequence limit for 3D modelling is 3000bp per sequence.

Instruction

* Click on 'connect' in the taskbar above.
* Click on 'Run all'.
* Upload txt or fasta file in propmpt
* For just sequence property and translation, run the first cell only.

Remember to allow multiple downloads so as to veiw your results
