The **Joint Interactive Nucleotide Analysis-Helix**  was developed at Helix Biogen Institute and is designed to calculate sequence lenght, GC content, start codon and stop codon, protein translation of DNA and RNA sequences and predict the 3D model of the sequence. 

Input should be single DNA sequences without the title or symbols.

Maximum Sequence size for Seqeunce Properties depends on system resources

Maximum sequence limit for 3D modelling is 1000bp.

Instruction

* Paste your sequence in the 'sequence' line.
* Click on 'connect' in the taskbar above.
* Click on 'Run all'
* For just sequence property and translation, run the first cell only
